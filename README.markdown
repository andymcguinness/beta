# Welcome!

Welcome to this theme! This is m3studios, a theme based around [my personal website](www.andymcguinness.com). It is rooted in my branding, and I'm quite pleased with how it turned out. Have a look at the docs, if you'd like!

## Basics

This theme is a child theme of Reverie, by Themefortress. It's all done in CSS (not a Sass fanatic... yet), and it features a logo font for the menu image, a custom portfolio plugin I built, and quite a lovely color scheme if I do say so myself! It's also responsive, which is, you know, pretty cool.

## Versioning

This beautiful theme is currently in __Version 0.2__. The basics are there, and now I'm adding fun stuff, like plugins and icon fonts.

## Compatibility

The theme will eventually be tested to be compatible down to IE8. Any lower, and I have no idea why you're still putzing around the internet with that thing. Upgrade if you can, my friend. The world wide web is a beautiful place these days.

## Required Extras

The theme pretty much requires the __m3 Portfolio__ plugin to function. It's not essential to anything but my portfolio, but my portfolio's pretty essential to my site. So there you have it.

## Off-canvas

The off-canvas on this theme is my own special blend of Pushy. It uses some extra Javascript functions I whipped up to make Pushy behave like a well-oiled machine. Coming soon: touch gestures.
